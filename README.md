# Brain Tumor Classification

This project is focused on developing an AI-based system for classifying brain tumor images. The goal is to create a tool that can assist in early diagnosis by accurately distinguishing between 4 classes - pituitary tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, and non-tumor cases using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Overview

By leveraging deep learning, this project aims to automate and streamline the analysis of brain MRI scans, potentially aiding medical professionals in making timely decisions.

## Dataset

- **Data Description:** The dataset comprises MRI images labeled according to the presence of each of the 3 brain tumors or the absence of brain tumors.
